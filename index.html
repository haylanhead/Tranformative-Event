          <h2>Why Did I Choose To Talk About Computers?</h2>
          <p>I chose to talk about computeres because my whole life I have been growing up around computers. Every computer that I have ever had since the age of 5-6 I have built myself with the help from others, this has led to me wanting to understand computers more from how they are built to how they have changed since the beggining of their exsitance, I thought that they would be a great choice for this project because it gave me a reason to do a deep dive on the cool and interesting history, and understanding on computers as a whole.</p>
