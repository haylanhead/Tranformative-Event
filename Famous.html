      <h2>Charles Babbage</h2>
      <h3>1791-1871</h3>
      <div class="img"><img src="Images\CharlesBabbage.jpg" alt="A Picture of Charles Babbage"</div>
      <p>Charles was known for being the first one to come up with the computer. He called it the Analytical Engine that did have some aspects of modern computers in it. He had come up with the concept of a computer, and he had plans made to build it but his plan never came to fruition thus making the analytical machine a twinkle in ones imagination.</p>

        <p>Ada was known for being the first “programmer” she was friends with Charles Babage and she found Charles Babages plans so interesting that she took to writing algorithms that could have been used on Charles’s engine.

      <div class="img"><img src="Images\AlanTuring.jpg" alt="A Picture of Alan Turing"</div>
      <p>During WWII the Germans made a machine that could encrypt messages. But Alan led a team to crack these messages, This team had saved many lives during WWII. Many Computer Programmers have remembered Alan by naming an algorithm after him and it's called the Turing machine The turing machine could of computated mathematical equations. The turing machine was never created</p>

      <p>Guido made the first user-friendly and widely accessible programming language known as python. Python is the most widely used and recognized language because of how simple it is to use and how many use cases it has.</p>
