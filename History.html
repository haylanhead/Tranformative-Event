            <li><p>1801 - the loom used wooden punch cards to automatically weave fabric designs, and it made making carpets and fabric designs much easier and faster than by hand.</p></li>
            <li><p>1821 - English mathematician Charles Babbage conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers. Funded by the British government, the project, called the "Difference Engine" fails due to the lack of technology at the time.</p></li>
            <li><p>1853 - Swedish inventor Per Georg Scheutz and his son Edvard design the world's first printing calculator. The machine is significant for being the first to "compute tabular differences and print the results,"</p></li>
            <li><p>1890 - Herman Hollerith designs a punch-card system to help calculate the 1890 U.S. Census. The machine,  saves the government several years of calculations, and the U.S. taxpayer approximately $5 million</p></li>
            <li><p>1911 - IBM is founded it took IBM 22 years to release an IBM branded product they started off by releasing electronic typewriters</p></li>

          <li><p>1931 - The first actual computer was created, called the differential analyzer, it was the first large scale automatic general-purpose mechanical analog computer.</p></li>
          <li><p>1939 - Hewlett-Packard was founded and today you might know them as HP.</p></li>
          <li><p>1941 - the first digital computer was created and it was called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer it was the first of its kind to be able to store things on its main memory, it was also able to perform one operation every 15 seconds</p></li>
          <li><p>1947 - the first transistors are created and there is no more need for vacuums</p></li>
