      <h1>What are the effects of computers on our society today?</h1>

        <h2>Computers and the entertainer</h2>
          <p>Computers have changed the way we as a society entertain our selves, from simply watching a youtube video to playing video games.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Computers in schools</h2>
          <p>Computers have been one of the greatest things that we take for granted. For example in the classroom computers have made doing assingments a whole lot easier, from being able to understand material to being able to solve probelsm with calculators. computers have not only made our lifes easier but they have also allowed us to do once impossible things, like go the moon and back safely.</p>

        <h2>Computers and the unthinkable</h2>
          <p>Humans as a society thousands of years ago once looked up into the sky and we said i wonder whats up there. wihtout computers we may have never known, it's still impressive how we were able to use the stars to know where we are. But being able to send something into space and take a picture of a star, wouldnt have been possible without computers. Computers and space have also allowed us to explore stuff like our moon and other plantes like mars. so we can get a better understanding of our solar system.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Computers and the negatives</h2>
        <p>Computers have helped change our society for the better, but they have also been changing our society in a negative way. for example there is cyberbulling and it only exsists thanks to computers. there can also be health issues if you use computers for too long. Old computer hardware unless recycled ends up in the ecosystem thus creating e-waste there is 50 million metric tons of e-waste generated on our planet each year.</p>
